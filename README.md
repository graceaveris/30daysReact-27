**Day Twenty Seven - 30 days of React challenge - Geography App using nested routes to display data from API**

A react app with a website feel, shows nested routes as url and calls data from an API depending on the routes selected. See facts about various countries and continents.

**Concepts Explored:**

- Using react-router-dom to set up nested routes
- Using URL params to pass data to a child
- using match to access param data
- Using an API in conjunction with react router
- Using the lifecycle method componentWillUpdate()
- Forcing a child component to update by passing a dummy prop

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
